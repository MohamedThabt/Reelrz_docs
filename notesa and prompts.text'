then i want you create mermaid code to draw ERD digrame for this database tables
and check this logic

  - name 
   * email 
   * time stamp
- conversation 
   - id 
  - label 
  - user id forignkey null on delete

	- user id
	- user role (Enum (member , admin ))
	- joined at 
- message 
	- id
	- converstion id  
	- user id 
	- type 
	- body 
- recipients 
	- user id cascade on delete 
	- message id 	cascade on delete 
	- read date (time stamp )

erDiagram
    USERS {
        int id PK
        string name
        string email
        string password_hash
        string avatar_url
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    CONVERSATIONS {
        int id PK
        string title
        string description
        enum type "direct/group"
        int created_by FK "Non-null creator"
        int last_message_id FK "Reference to messages.id"
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    PARTICIPANTS {
        int id PK
        int conversation_id FK
        int user_id FK
        enum role "member/admin/owner"
        boolean is_muted
        timestamp joined_at
    }
    
    MESSAGES {
        int id PK
        int conversation_id FK
        int user_id FK
        enum type "text/image/file"
        text content
        string media_url "For images/files"
        boolean is_edited
        boolean is_deleted
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    RECIPIENTS {
        int id PK
        int message_id FK
        int user_id FK
        boolean is_delivered
        boolean is_read
        timestamp delivered_at
        timestamp read_at
    }
    

    



    USERS ||--o{ CONVERSATIONS : "created_by"
    CONVERSATIONS ||--o{ PARTICIPANTS : "has"
    USERS ||--o{ PARTICIPANTS : "is"
    CONVERSATIONS ||--o{ MESSAGES : "contains"
    USERS ||--o{ MESSAGES : "authored"
    MESSAGES ||--o{ RECIPIENTS : "delivered_to"
    USERS ||--o{ RECIPIENTS : "received"



based on this controller create documentation in markdown form that has

all api end point with https methods
all responses for success and exceptions
and examplse for ever responses
every response has :
	- status
